Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day.
It should return a pair of days representing the min day to buy and the min day to sell. Days start at 0.

> stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10])
=> [1,4]  # for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
Quick Tips:

You need to buy before you can sell
Pay attention to edge cases like when the lowest day is the last day or the highest day is the first day.

          profit_max = profit
          days = [buy_index, sell_index]
